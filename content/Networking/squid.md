Summary: deploy non-transparent squid in docker for network monitoring and filtering 

# TODO
1. fix title formatting on website, markdown seems to have differernt styling than RST

We are looking to create a non-transparent proxy server using Squid for networking sniffing. The end product should be able to sniff both HTTP and HTTPS traffic. 

# Transparent proxy server vs non-transparent proxy server

Both types proxy servers are able to relay traffic from client machine. Transparent proxy is the easier setup. It allows quick access to the web for everyone without configuration from client side. 

The down side of a transparent proxy is that it provides limited function to perform network traffic monitoring and filtering. Only HTTP traffic can be monitored. 

A non-transparent proxy on the other hand, provides a much more powerful and flexiable proxying service. It can relay HTTPS traffic as a man-in-the-middle proxy by forging its own SSL certificate. However, in order to achive this, server's CA certificate must be installed and trusted as a root certificate on client's machine. 

In this project, we will explorer setting up a non-transparent proxy server using squid and containerize it into a docker. This container can later be used with an ICAP service to perform network traffic filtering in the future. 

# Squid docker

A popular proxy software, [link](http://www.squid-cache.org/). The `Dockerfile` is created and the content is as followed.


```
FROM ubuntu:18.04

ENV SQUID_VERSION=3.5.27 \
    SQUID_DIR=/usr/local/squid \
    SQUID_USER=proxy

RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install build-essential openssl libssl1.0-dev wget -y

WORKDIR /tmp
RUN wget http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/squid-${SQUID_VERSION}.tar.gz
RUN tar -xzf squid-${SQUID_VERSION}.tar.gz
WORKDIR /tmp/squid-${SQUID_VERSION}

RUN chmod +x configure
RUN ./configure \
        --datadir=/usr/share/squid \
        --sysconfdir=/etc/squid \
        --libexecdir=/usr/lib/squid \
        --with-pidfile=/var/run/squid.pid \

        --enable-icap-client \
        --enable-ssl \
        --enable-ssl-crtd \
        --with-openssl \
        --enable-follow-x-forwarded-for \
        --with-default-user=${SQUID_USER}
RUN make
RUN make install

ENV PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/squid/sbin
RUN /usr/lib/squid/ssl_crtd -c -s /var/lib/ssl_db # SSL certificate database directory

RUN mkdir -p ${SQUID_DIR}
RUN chmod -R 755 ${SQUID_DIR}
RUN chown -R ${SQUID_USER}:${SQUID_USER} ${SQUID_DIR}
RUN chown -R ${SQUID_USER}:${SQUID_USER} /usr/lib/squid/ssl_crtd

EXPOSE 3128/tcp
```


In addition to the `Dockerfile`, there are 5 more files that are important. 

```
/usr/local/squid/var/cache  # cache
/usr/local/squid/var/logs   # logs
/etc/squid/squid.conf       # squid configuration file
/usr/local/squid/ca.crt     # ssl certificate
/usr/local/squid/ca.key     # ssl private key
```

These files will be mapped to the host system in `docker-compose.yml` file. 

`ca.crt` and `ca.key` are our server SSL certificate and keys. They can be generated using this script. 

```
#!/bin/sh

openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048
openssl req -new -x509 -days 3650 -key ca.key -out ca.crt -subj "/CN=XXXXX CA"
openssl genrsa -out cert.key 2048
```

Replace `XXXXX` with the name at your choice. 

`squid.conf` is squid configuration file. Here is an example

```
#defaults

acl localnet src 172.16.0.0/12

```


At last, the `docker-compose.yml` that puts everything together. 

```
version: '3'

services:
  squid:
    build: ./
    ports:
      - "8888:3128"
    volumes:
      - ./cache:/usr/local/squid/var/cache
      - ./logs:/usr/local/squid/var/logs
      - ./squid.conf:/etc/squid/squid.conf
      - ./ca.crt:/usr/local/squid/ca.crt
      - ./ca.key:/usr/local/squid/ca.key
    restart: always
    command: squid -f /etc/squid/squid.conf -NYCd 1
```

The folder structure should look like this:


```

squid/
    ca.crt
    ca.key
    cert.key
    docker-compose.yml
    Dockerfile
    squid.conf
    cache/
    logs/

```

Start the squid docker by running `docker-compose up`. Docker should start building the docker image. At the very end, the console should have a print out like this. 

```

# Client setup

On client machine, install the server certificate `ca.crt` as Trusted Root Certification Authorities, refer to [Windows and Linux](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/Installation/Install_a_trusted_root_CA__or_self-signed_certificate), and [Mac](https://pubs.vmware.com/flex-1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.vmware.horizon.flex.admin.doc%2FGUID-9201A917-D476-40EF-B1F4-BBF14AB83D94.html).

Configure the proxy setting on your machine to ip `localhost` and port `8888`. If the client is on a different machine, you need to open port `8888` on the server side and configure client to the server's ip and port `8888`. 

Once everything configured, go to google.ca and check its SSL certificate, the certificate should say its issued by XXXXX instead of Google. But all certificate encryption and signiture should be valid as we have trusted our own CA certificate on the client machine.
