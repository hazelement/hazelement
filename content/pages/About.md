Summary: because of a passion in programming


I used to be a mechanical engineer who worked in the oil and gas industry. The downturn of the oil price has driven thousands of people out of employment and I am one of them. But with my great interest and experience in programming, I started working at a software developer at a startup company. The world is brand new to me and I'm learning great things everyday.
