## Interesting spots:

### March 24

* US has taken over Italy on daily incrementals.
* Both US and Italy will have more cases than China
* Italy has seen effective results from the lock down. Their daily incrementals is flattening out. 

### March 15

* After US approved widespread virus testing, number of confirmed cases jumped. This means that the virus was already spreading actively. 
* Second jump in US is interesting but there is no significant public event associated with it. 
* After China's Wuhan lock down. It takes 4 weeks for the virus to calm down. Given virus takes 2 weeks to show symptom on average. We can probably say the transmission slows down after 2 weeks of lock down. 
* Given Wuhan's data, we can say it will take 2 weeks of lock down to slow down the transmission and another 2 weeks to contain the spread. If lock down stops within this 4 weeks. The effort will be gone and we may see the virus start spreading again. 
* Italy started national lock down on day 20. We shall see how this pan out according to discovery above. 

Important call out:

* Controlling the spread using lockdown is important as it eases the load our health system. 
* It will take 4 weeks for lockdown to effectively decrease cases. That is if the healthy care system is currently under load or over loaded and we start the lockdown right now. The situation in our medical system will not improve until 4 weeks later.
